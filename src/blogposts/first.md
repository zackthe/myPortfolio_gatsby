# It's cause and effect !  

Feeling unmotivated? feeling guilty of not doing the thing you said you're going to do, you wanna get started but you cannot find enough motivation? well the first thing you gotta know is this is normal, this is human nature, nothing to blame here, before I wrote this blogpost I was running through the same phases, and let me enlight you `it's cause and effect.`

First, let me introduce you to the one and only mister `DOPAMINE`, you should be careful when dealing with mister `dopamine`, or he'll mess with your life as a whole, so what is dopamine? dopamine it's the `chemical` (not a hormone) produced in your brain that's responsible for your `motivation`, for example when you see a delicious meal, your brain produces dopamine that makes you take action to go and eat it, in a nutshell, dopamine is what motivate you to take `action`.

# Thinking motivation as a system!

Dealing with motivation is such a pain in the ass, especially when you have a lot of work to do, it becomes a nightmare to just thinking about it, that's where a motivation system will save your life, basically, you gotta think in terms of `inputs` and `outputs`, means you should carefully track you daily inputs, what you're consuming during the day, if you're playing video games probably you'll end up playing for a long time (freefire gang), or if you're scrolling on social media you'll keep scrolling for a long time, the `notification bell` is a great example of producing dopamine and getting motivated to read the message, or in other example watching TV-shows, those are the killers for your motivation in nowadays.

The way games, social media, TV-shows built is to `keep you as long as possible` in their platform, there is a dedicated team of architects, behavioral psychologists and more that are paid to do that, your mission here is to be aware when you're consuming such a product, at that particular moment you're overstimulating  your brain release of dopamine, watching the latest episode from breaking bad is much more fun than solving a hard maths problem, this overstimulation causes you pain when dealing normal or boring tasks, then you'll feel unmotivated and near impossible to commit to a task that doesn't stimulate your brain, or  does not produce as much dopamine as games or social media.

Going back to the `system`, the `inputs` is when you're consuming games or social media and it causes you overstimulation, and the `outputs` is you procrastinating and feeling guilty, so in this particular moment your next step is to `regulate` your dopamine release, and be aware of the `dopamine triggers`, here is how : basically you are going to try to reduce or eliminate them from your daily inputs or if you're using them for an academic or professional purpose, try to remind yourself what your primary objective of using that tool, try to turn off notifications, try to outsmart your instincts, applying this tricks will help you immensely.

# Why will power is a bullshit!! ?

When we deal with motivation issues, we always say that we lack `will power`, and sabotaging ourselves for not doing the work and feeling guilty, and let me tell you that will power is also produced by your brain, the only difference is that it runs off quickly and doesn't last too much versus its enemy mister dopamine, if you're trying to outsmart your brain and think that you got will power and `dopamine triggers` will not affect you and you're strong enough to beat their asses, let me inform you that you already lost, trying to relay on will power is like going to war with `vegetable knife` versus an army, you already know the outcome.

# How the most boring tasks become more enjoyable?

With `this simple concept` of dopamine, the people who you think are always motivated to work, and they got some sort of secret or they are stronger than others, the only difference is that they understand how the brain works, and therefore they are limiting their dopamine intakes, and letting space for other tasks say boring or unpleasant become more fun, some of theme take it to the next level and they become `addicted`, the unpleasant tasks like solving hard problems is what `generate wealth`.

# Getting started :

Well, hard things will always remain hard, but our objective is to make the path easier, relying on motivation or will power is not the best option if you got a long road, try to apply the `motivation system`, face of the devil and break down big tasks into smaller tasks and let your brain manage the work for you, it's a muscle and in order to grow you gotta make sure you feed it with high-quality content.
